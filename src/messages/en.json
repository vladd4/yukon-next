        "khmil_description_1": "<p>Before jumping into an unknown body of water, it's wise to study its bottom.</p> <p>The retail sector is leading in popularity for starting commercial activities. A particular niche in this segment is alcoholic retail, with 60% of it being beer sales. The steady demand for this product, affordable prices, and the presence of strong national producers contribute to the development of the beer business.</p> <p>Beer is the oldest drink that has gained popularity for its ability to quench thirst. Its variety and range still attract consumers today.</p> <p>With nearly a quarter-century of experience in beer distribution in the Volyn region, understanding the audience and existing competitors, Yukon decided to take the risk and open a beer shop. The beer retail segment is saturated with players. It has experience and resources on its side. That is why we chose a proven path and opted for a franchise from <b>JSC Carlsberg Ukraine</b>. Together with competent and experienced 'Carlsberg' managers, we assessed the strengths and weaknesses of the future business and developed an effective customer acquisition strategy. We went through a multi-stage quest from location scouting to the official opening.</p>",
        "khmil_description_2": "<p>Thus, in April, a modern chain store of draft beer and related products <b>The Хміль</b> opened its doors for the first time in the elite new building of the residential complex 'Barcelona' (T. Borovets Street, 12a) in the city of Kovel. It features a wide selection of beer from popular domestic (Lviv Brewery) and foreign (Carlsberg, Warsteiner, Guinness, Grimbergen, etc.) producers, ranging from well-known classics to the latest examples. Our lineup includes over twenty varieties of draft beer, from tasty and light lagers reflecting the tastes and character of the country of origin to more interesting and exotic varieties, each with its own story.</p> <p>16 types of beer are served in PET bottles and sold for takeout. Additionally, we have 8 beer taps for on-premise consumption. For connoisseurs, we offer craft beer. The store's assortment is crafted not only based on customers' taste preferences but also considering their changing moods. Each sip of our beer offers not only taste but also an emotion, allowing you to experience this seemingly well-known drink in a new way. Knowledgeable staff provide professional advice to meet even the most demanding customers' preferences. It is important to us that even the most demanding client leaves satisfied.</p> <p>In addition to a variety of draft beer, 'The Хміль' also offers bottled beer of different styles, brands, and labels. To complement the slight bitterness of dark beers and the taste of slightly roasted malt in light beers, the shelves are stocked with numerous beer snacks, chips, nuts, dried and cured fish, and meat. For lovers of strong alcoholic beverages, the store features displays of popular and premium alcohol. For the ladies, we have a wide selection of low-alcohol and non-alcoholic drinks, wines, champagne, and cider. The store also offers treats for little sweet tooths.

Even Ukrainians, despite the war and the threat of blackouts, have started to buy more 'green' cars.</p> <p>In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of electric vehicles globally. As of November 2023, Ukraine had 75,257 electric vehicles, including 1,806 in Volyn.</p> <p>In just one year, this number has significantly increased, and on a national level, it has reached nearly 150,000 vehicles, with almost 4,000 of them having Volyn license plates.</p>",
         "leleka_description_2": "<p>In our country, the trend of electric car ownership is gaining momentum, and the expansion of high-speed charging stations is a key factor contributing to the popularity of eco-friendly transportation. The fleet of vehicles using alternative fuels is clearly increasing, making it a logical decision to open a business based on electric charging stations.</p> <p>After analyzing information on the development of the European electric mobility market, studying successful Ukrainian business cases, and considering all unforeseen circumstances due to the wartime situation, we took the risk and last year, thanks to cooperation <b>with the GO TO-U operator in Kovel</b>, installed the first and most powerful charging station in Volyn. The realization of the business plan became possible thanks to state support, particularly the favorable position within the state program <b>“Affordable Loans 5-7-9%”</b> from <b>AB “Ukrgasbank”</b>. Our charging station is equipped with a high-speed charging unit <b>with a capacity of 120 kW</b> and the following connectors:</p> <p>- CCS2 - 100 kW,</p> <p>- GB/T DC - 100 kW,</p> <p>- CHAdeMO - 50 kW,</p> <p>- Type 2 - 22 kW.</p>",
        "leleka_description_3": "<p>Its location is also optimal for customers. The charging station is located in Kovel at Shevchenka St. 28, just a few minutes' drive from the international highway ‘Kyiv - Kovel - Yagodyn’, as well as the regional roads ‘Kovel - Lutsk’ and ‘Kovel - Lviv’.</p> <p><b>In one year of operation</b>, our charging station has charged 3,765 vehicles, <b>which reduced CO2 emissions by nearly 100 tons</b>. Isn't that a positive result? It is clear that the future of electric cars is inevitable. Sooner or later, all drivers will feel the ‘benefits’ of using a ‘clean electric car’ and choose eco-friendly transportation. And we will do everything we can to contribute to this by actively developing the infrastructure.</p> <p>While your vehicle charges at our station, you can enjoy a delicious meal and a fragrant coffee at the 'Beerton' cafe <a>https://www.instagram.com/_beerton/</a>, visit the craft fish shop 'RibaLove' <a>https://www.instagram.com/rybalove_shop/</a>, or even 'find your pair' at the textile shop 'TWINSOCKS-MARKET' <a>https://twinsocks.com.ua/</a>.
